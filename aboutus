	<h3>A Word from the Founder & CEO...

                      Margaret R. Hamilton</h3>
  <p>New Life Ministries was born as a result of my response to a cry for help. It was January 1992 that I met a young woman who expressed a sincere desire to change her life. Chemically dependent and floundering in a system which reinforced her feelings of guilt and inadequacy she took a chance and reached out to me. Little did I know this was the beginning of a whole new life for both of us.



Being led by the spirit of God I began to make myself available to many such women. Some had enmeshed in a cycle of “victim-less" crimes, some were in danger of permanently losing their children, all were in danger of losing their futures as victims of chemical abuse. These women were in need of a place where they could find safety, encouragement and nurturing. New Life Residential Center Inc. was born as a result of this need on June 14, 1993.



Over the years women of all demographics, backgrounds and stations in life have come through our doors…different in many ways but all sharing one challenge…CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY. The New Life Residential Center has and will continue to support these women to break the cycle of dependency and offer time tested methodologies for conquering old behaviors and boldly embracing new life changing behaviors.

		Our Philosophy
		<p>It is our philosophy that recovery must be the total focus of your three months at New Life Residential Center.  We expect that you will spend as much energy, if not more, into obtaining your recovery as you did in obtaining your drug of choice.  In return, we pledge to support you on this exciting journey which you have begun.</p>



<p>We believe that recovery goes beyond abstinence from drugs and alcohol. It involves a conscious and intentional split from the people, places, things and behaviors that were present in your life during active use.</p>



<p>We also believe that few can accomplish this change alone; therefore the environment that has been created at New Life Residential Center provides support and insight from a group of people who have also dedicated their lives to the recovery process.</p>
